<title>Venus Installation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Venus has been tested on Linux, and Mac OSX, and Windows.</p>

<p>You'll need at least Python 2.2 installed on your system, we recommend
Python 2.4 though as there may be bugs with the earlier libraries.</p>

<p>Everything Pythonesque Planet need to provide basic operation should be
included in the distribution.  Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of XSLT requires either
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html">xsltproc</a>
or <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/python.html">python-libxslt</a>.</li>
<li>The current interface to filters written in non-templating languages
(e.g., python) uses the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-subprocess.html">subprocess</a>
module which was introduced in Python 2.4.</li>
<li>Usage of FOAF as a reading list requires
<a href="http://librdf.org/">librdf</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are reading this online, you will need to
<a href="..">download</a> and extract the files into a folder somewhere.
You can place this wherever you like, <code>~/planet</code>
and <code>~/venus</code> are good
choices, but so's anywhere else you prefer.</p></li>
<li><p>This is very important: from within that directory, type the following
command:</p>
<blockquote><code>python runtests.py</code></blockquote>
<p>This should take anywhere from a one to ten seconds to execute.  No network
connection is required, and the script cleans up after itself.  If the
script completes with an "OK", you are good to go.  Otherwise stopping here
and inquiring on the
<a href="http://lists.planetplanet.org/mailman/listinfo/devel">mailing list</a>
 is a good idea as it can save you lots of frustration down the road.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a copy of one of the <code>ini</code> the files in the
<a href="../examples">examples</a> subdirectory,
and put it wherever you like; I like to use the Planet's name (so
<code>~/planet/debian</code>), but it's really up to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the <code>config.ini</code> file in this directory to taste,
it's pretty well documented so you shouldn't have any problems here.  Pay
particular attention to the <code>output_dir</code> option, which should be
readable by your web server.  If the directory you specify in your
<code>cache_dir</code> exists; make sure that it is empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Run it: <code>python planet.py pathto/config.ini</code></p>
<p>You'll want to add this to cron, make sure you run it from the
right directory.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional)</p>
<p>Tell us about it! We'd love to link to you on planetplanet.org :-)</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional)</p>
<p>Build your own themes, templates, or filters!  And share!</p></li>
